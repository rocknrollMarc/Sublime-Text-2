Improvements:

* Debounce save to improve performance dramatically.
  - New setting called "auto_save_delay_in_seconds", which defaults to 1.
  - The higher this number, the longer "save" is debounced.
  - Anywhere between 1-3 seconds is reasonable.
  - Set to 0 to avoid debouncing all together (not recommended).
