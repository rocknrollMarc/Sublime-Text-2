Thank you for installing the Grails plugin!


Features
--------

* Code completions for Grails file types, with automatic file type detection (Controllers, Services, and Domain classes for now)

* Enable comment toggling in Groovy code and use GSP comments (%{-- --}%) in GSPs

* GSP syntax highlighter

* Grails documentation (GDoc) syntax highlighting and snippets

(Note: your color scheme might need to be adjusted to recognize the syntax highlighting changes)
