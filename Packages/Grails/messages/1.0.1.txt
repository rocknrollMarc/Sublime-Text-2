Your Grails plugin has been updated to version 1.0.1.


Changes
-------

The GSP syntax highlighting has been completely re-written. Besides simplifying the file, several issues should be resolved now:
	- Division followed by a closing HTML tag is no longer treated as a regex (reported by dylanbromby)
	- Improved embedded ternary operator highlighting (reported by hayseed)
	- Highlighting of code embedded in HTML attributes (reported by tom-metz)
	- Javascript highlighting within <r:script> tags (reported and fixed by Guigoz)
	- More consistent scope naming

Please note that we now provide modified versions of the HTML and Groovy syntax files (used *only* in GSP files), so any local changes you may have in those files will not be applied to GSP files.

My testing shows much improved highlighting using most of the standard color schemes, but it is still not perfect. I suspect there will always be some edge cases that we simply can't detect due to the way syntax highlighting works in Sublime (that's the price for having such a snappy editor!). That being said, please do report any problems you find, and we'll see if something can be done. Full code examples and screenshots are useful!

Thanks to everyone who took the time to report an issue, and especially to Guigoz for sending a pull request with a fix :)
