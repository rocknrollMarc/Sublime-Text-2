The package by default installs a menu entry in the Tools menu, under Java.
It also comes bound to the Ctrl+K then Ctrl+J key combination sequence 
(or Command+K then Command+J on Macs).

How to make it work:

- Select the properties from your class from which you want to generate
  getters and setters.

- Go to Tools->Java->Java Setter Getter (or hit the Ctrl+K then Ctrl+J sequence)
- Your getters and setters should be ready to go.
